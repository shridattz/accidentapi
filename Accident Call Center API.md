## Pipes IVR - Requalification

Explained below is the lifecycle of how the lead is sent across pipes and team alert.

When a Lead is sent by an Affiliate, Accident.com sends it to Alert for requalification. Lead gets created in Alert's system and the customerID is with alert.

1.  If requalification is a success, we attempt auto-assignment / assert a response.
2.  If requalification is not a lead, refused intake, we assert a response.
3.  If requalification was unresponsive, and disputed and sent with the status - "Max Reach - Intake Required"
	- We send such leads to pipes IVR, to make additional call attempts.
	 -   If the lead chooses to speak to Accident.com ( Team Alert's Call Center Reps), we send the call directly to the PIPES DID.
			-   When Alert receives such inbound calls, we believe the system can easily lookup the customerID for this lead
			-   Pipes forwards the lead's caller ID on this call and we've checked this.
			-   For all such requalifications, the scenario can only be #1 or #2 as mentioned above. We can either successfully re-qualify a lead or they reject to speak with us.
			-   There cannot be "Max Reach - Intake Required" for these leads, neither can they be sent as "**unresponsive**" or "**disqualified**".
			- We will need the `disqualify` param for leads with blank fields array ( no requalification data ) , if they have the status **Not a Lead** or **Refused Intake**

## Web Leads

This section is specifically for leads that we post on Alert's API. There can be two scenarios - Alert gets in touch with the lead ( Connected with the Lead ) or the lead doesn't pick up the calls ( Unresponsive Lead ) . 

### Connected with the Lead.

If Team Alert could connect with the lead that we posted, please formulate the request in below format.
Please see that there are three new parameters that you're expected to pass for all such leads.

 - `source` - which site referred this lead.
 - `customer_id` - the hashed identifier that we posted to your API
 - `number_of_calls` - how many calls were made to this lead by Team Alert.

Please check the request sample below.

    curl --location --request POST '<ENDPOINT>' \ --header 
    'Content-Type: application/json' \ --header 
    'api-secret: secret ' \ --header 'api-key: key' \ --data-raw '{ 
    "arrived_at": "2020-03-24 9:28:29",
    "converted_at": "2020-03-24 10:50:29",
    "test_mode": true,
    "lead_first_name": "testAdmediaryFirst",
    "lead_last_name": "testAdmediaryLast",
    "lead_email":"testadmediaryemail@yopmail.com",
    "lead_phone": "+919637245120",
    "case_type":"Personal Injury",
    "zip_code": "82201",
    "customer_id":"dm3a47xp2ARGM9EZlM6DrngoyqY8zV",
    "number_of_calls":"2",
    "caller_ID":"6467011444",
    "source" : "lawsuitwinning.com",
    "type":"lead",
    "fields": [
	    {
		    "ref": "incident_date_option_b",
		    "title": "When did the accident happen?",
		    "answer":"Less than 1 year"
	    },
	    {
		    "ref": "have_attorney",
		    "answer":"Yes"
	    },
	    {
		    "ref": "doctor_treatment",
		    "answer":"No"
	    },
	    {
		    "ref": "primary_injury",
		    "answer":"Broken Bones"
	    },
	    {
		    "ref": "comments",
		    "title": "Additional Details",
		    "answer":"Test lead comments "
	    }
	  ]
	}'


###  Unresponsive Lead

If the lead doesn't pick up the call, the request on our API should contain these three additional fields.

- `unresponsive` - set this field to `true`.
- `number_of_calls` - how many calls were made to this lead by Team Alert.
- `customer_id` - the hashed identifier that we posted to your API

We will disqualify this lead directly as we have not got in touch with the lead and it's unsellable.

    curl --location --request POST '<ENDPOINT>' \ --header 
    'Content-Type: application/json' \ --header 
    'api-secret: secret ' \ --header 'api-key: key' \ --data-raw '{ 
    "arrived_at": "2020-03-24 9:28:29",
    "converted_at": "2020-03-24 10:50:29",
    "test_mode": false,
    "lead_first_name": "testAdmediaryFirst",
    "lead_last_name": "testAdmediaryLast",
    "lead_email":"testadmediaryemail@yopmail.com",
    "lead_phone": "+919637245120",
    "case_type":"Personal Injury",
    "zip_code": "82201",
    "customer_id":"dm3a47xp2ARGM9EZlM6DrngoyqY8zV",
    "number_of_calls":"3",
    "unresponsive" : "true",
    "caller_ID":"6467011444",
    "type":"lead",
    "fields": [
	  ]
	}'

# Location Field Guide

This section discusses the use of location fields and how the API would react to requests. Mentioned below are the list of location fields that Accident's API would accept.

| Name | Required | Type | Description |
|--|--|--|--|
| zip_code  	| False  	|  US Zip Code	| Location of the Lead where the injury occured
| city  	| False  	|  Text	| Location of the Lead where the injury occured. `city` should be in text and used in combination with `state`. 
| state  	| False  	|  Text	| Location of the Lead where the injury occured. `state` should be in text and used in combination with `city`. 


 **NOTE**: 
 - If `zip_code`, `city`, `state` is provided in the request body and the `zip_code` is a valid US zip code, we will use it as a single reference to fetch `city`, `county`, `state` details. 
 - `city` and `state` in the request are only considered to fetch location when the `zip_code` provided is invalid.
 - The flow is as follows
	 -	check if `zip_code` is valid, if yes fetch additional details
	- if not, check for `city` and `state` in the request body.
- If `city` and `state` is provided in the request, we use them in combination to resolve a `zip_code` for the lead. From our location provider APIs we use the first zipcode in the results.
- If only `city` or only `state` is provide, we create the lead on our end but the lead will require a follow up from Team Accident to find an attorney. 
	- All such leads won't be automatically assigned.
- If any of the callers are not able to provide no `zip_code` or no `city`/`state` details, we recommend that Alert should disqualify the lead, setting `disqualify` as true. 

### Responses

If no location fields are populated in the request body, you would see a response like the one mentioned below.

    {  
	    "problems": [  
	        "zip_code, city, ref is missing in the request body"  
	    ],  
	    "lead_score": "",  
	    "call_ref": "",  
	    "attorney": [],  
	    "status": "failed"
    }

If the request body contains `disqualify` field, we will create the lead and the status will be disqualified. We won't be able to assign an attorney for such leads as there're no location details sent. Please make sure that `disqualify` is only used when there is no location.

**IMPORTANT NOTE** : The lead will not be created if there's no location fields in the request and  `disqualify` field is not provided. `disqualify` facilitates a way to create the lead without location information.

    {  
	    "problems": [  
	        "lead has been disqualified"  
	    ],  
	    "lead_score": 40,  
	    "call_ref": "jK6qPQERWpJeMxQl3kB8OmyX7LvDb4",  
	    "attorney": [],  
	    "message": "Lead generated successfully",  
	    "status": "created",  
	    "result": "disqualified"  
    }
